## How it works ?
Spytify records the sound that is coming out of it on your computer sound card. Even if it transcodes the song to an mp3 file, you won't be able to tell the difference between listening to the mp3 file and playing the song on Spotify, because this app, Spytify, provides the same quality that Spotify streaming quality (Spotify Free delivers 160kbps). But, be aware of the quality loss when comparing to a cd ripped file, if you expect flac quality you are not looking at the right tool, and Spotify at its best only delivers 320kbps, not an audiophile app, so no need to rip their songs.

### Standard Use
A standard use it's to start a recording session at night using your favorite playlist and let it work overnight, so you avoid waiting for it to end, because Spytify does not download but records. You will then get all your songs automatically split into separate tracks without ads. Don't forget that the output path can be your android music folder.
